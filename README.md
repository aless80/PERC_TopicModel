# PERC_TopicModel
LDA Topic Modeling of PERC Papers

This project focuses on using Latent Dirichlet Allocation to thematically analyze the physics education research literature, in the form of the Physics Education Research Conference Proceedings 2001-2018.

The main script requires installation of Gensim, a package for doing machine learning text analysis, along with standard data analysis libraries like pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. It also uses LDAVis, a package for visualizing topic models, and the Natural Language Tool Kit.
